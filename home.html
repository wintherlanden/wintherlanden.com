    <p>
        I am a young artist from Germany and my whole life is lanced by a fascination for northern, snowy and silent
        places.
    </p>

    <p>
        Only imagining this environment gives me a feeling of freedom and enhances my creativity.
    </p>

    <p>
        Especially portraiture is a huge passion of mine, since it sparks my highest ambition to transport the magic of
        each sitters desired expression.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the near future, I aim for traveling north and portraying people living in remote, mystic places.
