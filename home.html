    <p>
    I am a young artist from Germany whoose whole life is lanced by a fascination
    for northern, snowy and silent places.
    </p>

    <p>
    Only imagining this envirionment gives me a feeling of freedom
    and enhances my creativity.
    </p>

    <p>
    In the near future, I aim for travelling north and portraying people
    living in remote, mystic places.
    </p>

    <p>
    Portraiture is a huge passion of mine, since it stokes my continuous ambition
    to transport the magic of each sitters desired expression.
    </p>

<p>
    Feel free to take a look around
    and donâ€˜t hesitate to contact me for any requests!
